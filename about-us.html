    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      A supportive, calm and understanding veterinarian is akin to a warm blanket. Even when you don't need it, it reminds you of comfort. 
      Dr. Anand's pet's hospital in West Delhi/NCR is providing such services to its clients since the year 1983.
    </p>

      The care clinic was established to meet the need of veterinary emergencies & critical care for pets. 
      Being run by a team of essentially experienced veterinary professionals under the inspirational leadership of Dr. R.K Anand, 
      the center is excellent in its surgical, reproduction and ultrasound support and its recently set critical care unit.

      Ably supported by Dr. Gautam Anand, the clinic is flourishing in its service to exclusive beings of God providing uncompromising care 
      and assistance to all animals.
